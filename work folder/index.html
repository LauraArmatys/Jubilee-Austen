                  <h2>Portfolio Website Project</h2>
                  <p>This project truly helped me put my newfound skills of coding
                      to the test. I was timid when I began but after pushing through
                      my fear, I gained more confidence and realized I can create
                      beautiful things.

                  <h2>Rogue Pickings Project</h2>
                  <p>I took every piece of knowledge I acquired in my first project
                      then implented it into this one. I had to figure out my CSS styling and
                      had the ability to try new things!
